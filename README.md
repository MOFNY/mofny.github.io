# The Definitive Roy Oswalt Collection
## A personal site for cataloging and displaying images of my Roy Oswalt baseball cards.

I try to update the site as much as possible.

For my images I use a CanoScan 9000F Mark 2.

This is also a playground of sorts for me to get creative with CSS3/HTML5/JS.

The site is broken up into **5 major sections**:

+ Base, Inserts, and Parallels
+ Autographs
+ Game Used
+ Rookie Cards
+ 1/1s

Please check out [http://royoswalt44.com/](http://royoswalt44.com/ "The Definitive Roy Oswalt Collection") to see the latest.

A contact form can be found in the footer on every page.
