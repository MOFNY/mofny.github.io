      <h2>Developer, Designer, Leader</h2>
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>Hello there, thanks for visiting my portfolio. The opening animation was achieved entirely in CSS.  I needed a little jQuery for the custom tooltip, and to aid in the responsiveness.  All of my sites are custom made in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, &amp; jQuery. My usual process is to code everything from scratch.  I strive to create reusable and encapsulated code.  Recent projects include working with Node, Express, Jade, &amp; SASS.  This is one of my great passions in life: creating sites, layouts, UI/UX, or animations. I love to code.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>

            My job started out as a junior developer and ballooned rapidly.  In two months time, the back end manager and I released a redesign of Pavilion.  Since then, I have completely reimagined the site's potential; it now emits character and identity.  My role went from entry to manager and leader.
            <br />
        I fixed the myriad of issues beleaguering the site's structure.  I instilled a proper navigation, header structure, product browse and profile, and shopping cart. Large portions of the site uniquely utilizes AJAX.  The cart is the best example. Pavilion performs well on mobile devices, with specific optimizations made on the UI.
        <br />
        In mid-April, I made the most significant changes.  I created a UI/UX system that would make wholesale orders easier. I spearheaded the campaign for new and creative promos.  Promo codes are now added automatically for the convenience of our users.
        <br />
        By next month, the changes were working.  May reached the highest revenue ever.  June beat May by 13.74%.  When compared to 2014, June 2015 had a higher conversion rate by 54.36%, revenue by 67.13%, and quantity by 151.69%.

      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>My original intention was to breathe life into an outdated website.  Everything is orginal: from the CSS and HTML, to the color scheme and typography. The new site has a better navigation structure, a simpler contact form, and a Google Map for each property. I tweeked the OWL Carousel to my liking and for responsiveness. The site is responsive, utilizing flex display for a tight, easy-to-replicate structure.  The host is Github Pages.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>
        Every Tuesday this summer I teach middle school students web development.  The library provided me with advertising and a venue, so I decided to create a site to provide some more information.  The design, CSS, and HTML are all custom. Teaching has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  It has strengthened my patience and my problem solving skills.  The kid's work can be seen on my Codepen. This could help me expand into more teaching opportunities.
      </span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>Recently I decided to completely redesign my Roy Oswalt site.  It is currently in development.  Firstly, I changed hosts to Github Pages.  Weebly adds unnecessary and bloated code, and since I code from scratch, I knew Github would provide the best free hosting.  The layout employs flex display, so it is completely responsive.  The color scheme and fonts have a more modern feel.  Page speed has improved dramatically as well.  Overall, I will continue to develop it, and then it will become my new official site.  This has been tested on a laptop and iPad using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE10.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>My first site represents several years of work, even before I went to college.  The latest updates consist of a system that adds up cards and gives completion percentages.  My cards are displayed in lists with a system of floating buttons.  The user can easily navigate the page.  Hovering over any floating button will take the user to the top of that year.  My favorite part is the home page: the numbers are being loaded dynamically.  In short, all I have to do to update my site is add an li.  It also features a custom made CSS3/JS image slider, which has been thorougly tested.  It's also lightning fast (no jQuery), reusable, and encapsulated.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      <!--
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>This was the final from my HTML5 Mobile Applications class.  It portrays a fictional pizza place.  I wanted to be simple; so I went with a one page layout.  However, it is completely responsive, using CSS @media.  The form utilizes various HTML5 form applications for validating user input.  The rest was coded in JavaScript.  It will add up the order and give an alert detailing one's order.  Someday I would like to refactor the code and redesign the layout.  This is best when viewed in Firefox, Chrome, IE10, or Safari.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>My newest site features cross browser JSONP to get simple data from users with personal sites.  The numbers are being generated dynamically via a simple .txt file.  It's extremely easy for an individual to change their totals.  The totals and completion percentage will then change automatically on my site.  The design is also custom, and I utilized CSS3 display: flex for the layout.  The site is completely responsive.  This is currently a work in progress, but the main structure and feel of the site has been established.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      -->
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>In order to ease the process of updating my site, I created a jQuery plugin that adds up list items and gives me a completion percentage.  I thought my fellow collectors would benefit from this code, so I made it available with instructions.  There are currently two demo pages.  The user has the option to use the default settings or the custom options.  Using a ol/li is only optional.  One can change the parent/child selectors, the text, and the percentage decimal places.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>Please feel free to peruse my LinkedIn profile.  This is an excellent way to contact me or make a new connection.  I currently reside in Canandaigua, NY.  My hobbies include baseball card collecting/selling/trading and playing tennis and golf.  My occupations have been numerous; currently I'm a web developer at Pavilion.  Overall, I love to sit down with a blank HTML document and see what happens.</span><i class="fa fa-css3 fa-3x"></i></div>
      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>For sharing code amongst peers nothing beats CodePen.  In my profile you will find some of my recent code samples.  
      You will find numerous examples of my work, including many experiments with flex display. 
      If you want the freshest insights into my coding abilities, Codepen should be your first stop.

      <div class="spanWrapper"><i class="fa fa-html5 fa-3x"></i><span>I was paid to create code and advise Tim in the creation of his site.  His main process is to take preexisting CSV spreadsheets and convert them into HTML tables.  He has thousands of organized spreadsheets.  My job was to make his job easier.  Via JS, I target the Flikr img src/href and manipulate them to work in the Fancybox.  I have also styled his tables, created a to-the-top button with jQuery, formatted Fancybox to his liking, and debugged certain aspects.
